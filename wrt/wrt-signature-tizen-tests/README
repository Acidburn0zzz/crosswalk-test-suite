Introduction
----------------------------------------------
This test suite is for testing tizen basic featrue

----------------------------------------------
Test Environment
----------------------------------------------
1. Pre-install Testkit-Lite package.
2. Run these cases as "normal" user.

----------------------------------------------
Build and Run
----------------------------------------------
(Suppose you only get the source code and Testkit-Lite has been set up on your test machine.
 If you have obtained wrt-signature-tizen-tests ZIP packages, you can directly go to step 3 on the test machine;
 if you have not installed Testkit-Lite, you need to install the latest version.)

Test steps:
1. Prepare for building by running the following command:
   cd wrt-signature-tizen-tests

2. Build Zip packages by running the following command:
   ./pack.sh

3. Unzip packages and access wrt-signature-tizen-tests

4. Push packages to device by running the following command:
   sdb push bad_signature.xpk /tmp/
   sdb push signature.xpk /tmp/

5. Run test cases as "normal" user with the following command:
   sdb root on
   sdb shell
   xwalkctl --install /tmp/bad_signature.xpk
   xwalkctl --install /tmp/signature.xpk
