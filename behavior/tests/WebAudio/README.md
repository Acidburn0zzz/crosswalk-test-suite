# Chrome WebAudio Crash Sample

The example demonstrates that Chrome on Android currently has a problem with WebAudio. When repeatedly navigating to webpages with audio playback using WebAudio the app/browser crashes.

This is reproducable by running *Automatic WebAudio* in the provided example. It will repeatedly enter & exit a page that plays back a sound file using WebAudio. It will crash after a short time.
